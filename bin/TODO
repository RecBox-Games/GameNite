* dependencies -> ubuntu_dependencies
* move git_clone_... to its own file
* use git_clone_... in build_plugin_...

* we need a script that tests all outstanding changes (aka it doesn't use
  anything from rqn, just the latest commit on main branches of SystemApps,
  rqn-builder, etc. )

* need a command to see a diff between this set of checkouts and patch number N
  and similar commands like diff between patches N and M or list of commits
  between patches N and M
